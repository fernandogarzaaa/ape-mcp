//! CP/1 canonical types that ADAM puts on the wire.
//!
//! ADAM authors eight canonical types, but only some of them cross a boundary
//! today. This module ships typed structs for exactly those:
//!
//! - [`Mutation`] and [`ValidationRequest`] — sent to EVE for measurement.
//! - [`FitnessResult`] — read back from EVE and used to gate acceptance.
//!
//! The other ADAM-owned types (`Genome`, `Identity`, `Belief`, `Memory`,
//! `Skill`, `Capability`, `Reflection`) appear on the wire only as event
//! *subjects*: referenced by `subject_id` and `subject_type`, never as
//! payloads. A struct for each would be an abstraction with no caller,
//! requiring perpetual maintenance against a schema it never exercises — so
//! they are deliberately absent until something actually transmits them, at
//! which point they belong here.
//!
//! Cross-binding agreement on the absent types is still established: the
//! conformance suite validates every canonical type structurally over the
//! shared fixture corpus, which tests the encoding — the thing that has to
//! match.
