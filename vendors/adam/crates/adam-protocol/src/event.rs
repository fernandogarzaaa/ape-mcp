//! CP/1 events — the organism's nervous system.
//!
//! Subsystems announce facts; nothing calls anything directly. Before this,
//! ADAM's only observable trace was the governance audit log, which recorded
//! acceptances, rejections and rollbacks — three of the fifteen things worth
//! knowing. Everything else the organism did happened silently.
//!
//! An event names the canonical document it concerns (`subject_id` and
//! `subject_type`) and carries only enough payload to be readable in a log; the
//! full document is fetched by id when detail is needed. Keeping payloads to
//! scalars is what lets an event log stay cheap enough to always be on.
//!
//! The set is closed: consumers switch exhaustively over [`EventKind`], so
//! adding one is a CP/1 version change.
