//! The shared conformance suite.
//!
//! Every CP/1 binding, in every repository, runs the same five checks against
//! the same golden corpus. That is the entire mechanism keeping three
//! hand-written bindings in three languages agreeing about the wire — there is
//! no code generation and no shared library to enforce it, so this suite is
//! load-bearing rather than decorative.
//!
//! The checks, and the failure each one catches:
//!
//! 1. **Round trip.** Parsing a fixture and re-encoding it in canonical form
//!    reproduces the exact bytes. Catches a binding whose key ordering, number
//!    rendering or string escaping differs from the normative source — the
//!    class of bug that silently produces documents other components reject.
//! 2. **Seal.** Each fixture's `provenance.content_hash` is the true hash of
//!    the document with that member removed. Catches a binding that hashes a
//!    different byte sequence than it transmits.
//! 3. **Structure.** Required members are present with the right shapes, and
//!    basis-point members are integers in range. Catches a binding that would
//!    accept a float where the protocol forbids one.
//! 4. **Manifest.** The vendored copy of the corpus hashes to what the
//!    normative source recorded. Catches a binding running against a stale
//!    fixture file, which would make checks 1–3 pass against the wrong contract.
//! 5. **Provenance edges.** Document ids are unique within the corpus;
//!    `derived_from` ids resolve; `baseline.runs` equals `candidate.runs`; and a
//!    measured `FitnessResult` references a `SimulationCompleted` whose
//!    `subject_id` and reported run counts match. Catches a measurement that
//!    cannot be chained back to the specific run that produced it — including
//!    one that cites a real run for the wrong mutation, or the wrong count —
//!    which is indistinguishable from a fabricated one.
