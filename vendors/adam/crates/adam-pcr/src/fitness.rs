//! Measuring a mutation against the real workspace.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! EVE answers one question: does the change make a simulated human's
//! experience better? That is a real question, but it is not the only one, and
//! it is not the one the workspace asks. The workspace asks whether more
//! records got processed. A mutation can improve one and harm the other, and an
//! organism that can only hear EVE cannot notice that it happened.
//!
//! So this is a *second* evaluator, not a replacement. It implements the same
//! [`FitnessProvider`] seam, returns the same [`FitnessResult`], and is
//! verified by the same [`adam_eve::measure_and_verify`]. Nothing about the
//! adaptation gate changes; it simply now has a second thing that can speak to
//! it.
//!
//! # What it does not do
//!
//! It reports `composite_bp` and `runs`, and nothing else. There is no
//! simulated human here, so there is no frustration, trust or cognitive-load
//! number to report, and [`Measurement::objective`] gives no way to invent one.
//! Absent means *not measured*, which is the truth, and is not the same as
//! zero.
//!
//! # Honest limits
//!
//! EVE runs in a subprocess, so the boundary that stops ADAM authoring EVE's
//! evidence is enforced by the operating system. This provider runs *in ADAM's
//! own process*. It authors `Component::Pcr` documents from inside the same
//! address space as the organism they judge. That is a genuinely weaker
//! guarantee, not parity, and it is stated here rather than glossed: what
//! remains is that the objective is computed from bytes on disk that ADAM did
//! not write, and that the numbers come from [`Workspace::objective_bp`] rather
//! than from anything the organism says about itself.
