//! The developmental lifecycle: the organism's metabolism.
//!
//! Before this module, every stage of the lifecycle existed as a method
//! somewhere and nothing executed the sequence. `reflect` returned a summary
//! and consolidated nothing; there was no `observe`; consolidation from
//! repeated episodes into semantic memory was described in `adam-memory`'s
//! documentation and driven by nothing. The organism had organs and no
//! metabolism.
//!
//! [`LifecycleDriver`] executes the whole sequence, in order, with no
//! shortcuts:
//!
//! ```text
//! Observe → Experience → Reflect → Consolidate memory → Update beliefs
//!   → Generate mutations → Validate inside EVE → Measure fitness
//!   → Commit genome → continue operating
//! ```
//!
//! Every stage emits its CP/1 event, and every event of one turn shares a
//! correlation id — so a completed turn is reconstructible from the event log
//! alone, without joining against the organism's internal state.
//!
//! # What a turn does and does not do
//!
//! A turn never applies a change the organism cannot justify. Concretely:
//!
//! - A mutation touching the genome beyond `preferences.*` is validated in EVE
//!   and accepted only on an approving measurement. If EVE is unreachable, or
//!   declines to measure, or measures a regression, the proposal stays pending
//!   and the turn reports why.
//! - Advisory proposals (belief reconciliation, conflict investigation) are
//!   never auto-accepted, because accepting them applies nothing — they exist
//!   to be read by something that can act on them.
//! - A turn that proposes nothing is not a failure. Most turns should propose
//!   nothing; an organism that mutates on every observation is not learning,
//!   it is thrashing.
