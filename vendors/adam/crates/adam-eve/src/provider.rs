//! Where a fitness measurement comes from.
//!
//! [`FitnessProvider`] is the seam between ADAM and EVE. ADAM builds a
//! [`ValidationRequest`], hands it to a provider, and receives a
//! [`FitnessResult`]. It never links EVE, never imports an EVE type, and never
//! learns how the measurement was produced.
//!
//! [`Cp1Subprocess`] is the production implementation: it spawns EVE's CP/1
//! endpoint, writes one request line and reads one response line. Chosen over
//! HTTP because it needs no listener, no port allocation and no service
//! discovery for the common single-host case, and because a subprocess is a
//! real isolation boundary for a component whose job is running scenarios.
