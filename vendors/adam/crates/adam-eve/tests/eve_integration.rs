//! End-to-end: ADAM measures a real mutation by spawning the real EVE.
//!
//! Every other test in this crate uses a stub, which proves ADAM's half of the
//! contract but not that the two halves fit. This one runs the actual
//! transport: ADAM builds a `ValidationRequest`, spawns EVE's `eve-cp1`
//! endpoint, and parses what comes back — exercising canonical encoding,
//! sealing, envelope verification and the line protocol across a language
//! boundary, in both directions.
//!
//! It is skipped unless EVE is available, because ADAM must not grow a build
//! dependency on a TypeScript project — that dependency edge is precisely what
//! CP/1 exists to avoid. Point `ADAM_EVE_CP1` at a built EVE checkout to run it:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cd ../experience-validation-engine && npm ci && npm run build
//! ADAM_EVE_CP1="$PWD/bin/eve-cp1.js" cargo test -p adam-eve --test eve_integration
//! ```
//!
//! CI wires this up in the `eve-integration` job.
